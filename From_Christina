Hey guys, 

I'm still figuring GitHub out, but I thought I'd add something onto here instead of the group so we can get started. 
I know the project is like the discussion we had a few weeks back. 

Some ideas: 

We'll need a function that:

creates the board, 2D array.
Randomizes the symbols (#, ~) - could probably be part of create the board function too?
We need a Fire function
Searches for the symbols to check if the ship has sunk

Hi Christina, this is Evan. Im in the same boat figuring out github, but I dont think our github teams match how the instructor had us setup on Canvas. 
Your in PACE group 1 along with Alexus Harrell, Azarius DeBerry and Shannon O'Hara Wiora, which means im in the wrong place, maybe.

I found the info in the \\people\groups tabs in Canvas for the course on the left hand side menu.

This assignment has had kind of a difficult set of instructions implement.

Im going to look and see if its possible to enter or exit groups, but im happy to finally connect with someone! 
Everywhere else I was trying to reach students was dead air.
