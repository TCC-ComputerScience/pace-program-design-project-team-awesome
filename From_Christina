Hey guys, 

I'm still figuring GitHub out, but I thought I'd add something onto here instead of the group so we can get started. 
I know the project is like the discussion we had a few weeks back. 

Some ideas: 

We'll need a function that:

creates the board, 2D array.
Randomizes the symbols (#, ~) - could probably be part of create the board function too?
We need a Fire function
Searches for the symbols to check if the ship has sunk
